This is the data of US weather history in 2014 that was obtained from [FiveThirtyEight](https://github.com/fivethirtyeight/data/blob/master/us-weather-history/KCLT.csv)

The data layout looks like this

```{r weather}
weather <- read.csv("weather.csv")
weather[1:10,]
```

We will only focus on actual mean temperature and average precipitation data.

## Average Temperature

```{r avg_temp}
avg_temp <- weather[,2]
summary(avg_temp)
plot(avg_temp)
```

## Average Precipitation

```{r avg_precipitation}
avg_precipitation <- weather[,12]
summary(avg_precipitation)
plot(avg_precipitation)
```
